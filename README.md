Crystal Collector Game

This game was made using javascript and jquery.
This was an assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.
This is a fun, easy game to play with simple objectives.

If someone is looking at this nad is interested in recreating this game, feel free to look at my code.
If someone wanted to learn to do this on their own, I would suggest researching the following topics:

  html
  css
  javascript
  jquery
  
W3Schools, Kahn Acedmy, and Stack Overflow are great resources for searching such topics.
